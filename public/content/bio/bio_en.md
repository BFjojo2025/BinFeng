My research involves the development of a novel technique for the direct observation and quantification of electromagnetic fields using Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). As modern electronic and spintronics devices continue to shrink in size while increasing in functionality, the demand for precise characterization of their nanoscale electromagnetic field distributions has grown. However, no established method currently exists for visualizing such fields at the required high resolution.

In this work, I employ a specialized detector in the bright-field mode of STEM, which captures the minute deflections of transmitted electrons induced by local electromagnetic fields inside the material. By quantitatively interpreting these deflections, I aim to generate high-resolution maps of the internal electric field. To date, I have applied this method to a variety of systems, including semiconductor pâ€“n junctions, GaN-based semiconductor heterointerfaces, oxide grain boundaries, and magnetic memory devices, demonstrating both the versatility and the potential impact of this technique for advanced materials research.
